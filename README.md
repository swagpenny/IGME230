## Proposal
### Concept
By experiencing a kid's life in China, hopefully the player gets a deeper understanding of the Chinese culture. The game is also meant to bring up the awareness of mental issue such as teenager depression.
### Genre & Platform
RPG Â· Web-based
### Story
The story of the game is related to the programmer's personal experience. Due to the only child policy in China, the player was born with high expection from her family. By saying high expection, it simply means behaving well in school and to get good scores on tests. Besides luxury brands, the Chinese adults also gain their joy from comparing children's grades. Hopefully, the player can find a balance between everything and find a way out.
### Esthetics
The art will be in 2D hand drawing. No music is involved.
### Gameplay
All of the consequences in the game are based on your choice.
_Mental Health_: If you make too many negative choices, your health bar might drop too low which leads to a suicide.
_Parents' happiness_: Your choices will effect your parents' happiness bar which leads to different endings.
